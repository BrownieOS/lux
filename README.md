##lux
lux is an operating system under development for the PC. It aims to be flexible for general usage, and as such aims to be graphical, networking, and lightweight.  

Unfortunately, it is still in the very early stages of development, and there is nothing to see here. This repository exists just to track progress, nothing more. But just so you know how it will look like in the end, lux aims to recreate [xOS](https://github.com/omarrx024/xos) in C, with cleaner, more portable code.  

I can be contacted at omarx024@gmail.com. I am also user **omarrx024** on the OSDev Forum.
